c This subroutine initializes the parameters, you need to read the
c comments and specify them carefuly
c--------------------------------------------------------------------
c This is an example for RCR boundary condition with parameters
c Rd, R, and C which are distal, and proximal resistance and capacitor.

c For instance if pressure in 3D solver is in cgs and here mmHg
c pConv=1334=1.334D3, also if flowrate in 3D solver is mm^3/s and
c here is mL/s qConv=1000=1D3. In the case both solver are using same
c unites you can set these two conversion coefficients to 1D0
      pConv = 1D0
      qConv = 1D0

c Only when all the surfaces of you model are coupled with NeumannSrfs
c you may set this to .TRUE.
      pCorr = .FALSE.
      qCorr = .FALSE.

c Block for your inputs

c These two value should match to that of defined in solver.inp

c Number of unknowns that you need inside your lumped parameter network
      nUnknowns      = 2
c Number of time step between N and N+alpha, for higher values this code
c would be more accurate and more costly

c nUnknowns columns are the "X" values)

c Surface to X pointer: this defines which Unknown corresponds to which
c suface in "List of Neumann Surfaces" inside solver.inp
c For example, if you have "List of Neumann Surfaces= 2 8 4 ...."
c and you set "srfToXPtr = (/5,3,9,.../)"
C this means X(5) corresponds to surface 2, X(3) <-> surface 8,
c and X(9) <-> surface 4
c Also, Q(1) corresponds to the first element in srfToXPtr, in this
c example, Q(1)<=>X(5), Q(2)<=>X(3)
      srfToXPtr = (/1/)
c      srfToXdPtr = (/1/)
