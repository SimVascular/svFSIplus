You may need to install libxss, mpich2, or libgfortran.
If you're on linux these may work:

sudo apt-get install libxss
sudo apt-get install mpich2
sudo apt-get install gfortran

--------

To use Meshim on linux copy your license file into the simvascular directory and rename it meshsim-license.dat

--------

To add SimVascular to your path (this is very helpful with using svsolver), you will need to run the post-install script:

sudo bash setup-symlinks.sh

This script places symbolic links in /usr/local/bin to the simvascular executable scripts.
You may wish to edit the symbolic links.

Note that the solver can be run with mpiexec.
For example to run on two processors:
cd /folder/with/input
mpiexec -np 2 svsolver
